        <h1 class="title">The Butcher and The Vegetarian</h1>

        <p class="content">On the crossroads to paradise, there stood a greedy butcher, haggling with a poor woman seeking to feed her children. "Please, sir", she said, "I have not 
            the money for such expensive meats, and my children are starving!" "No!", shouted the butcher, "I work hard to butcher this meat, and will not be swayed by false
            pity and withering women!"

            Suddenly, a kind stranger comes to the squabble and calmly states, "Give the woman all the food she desires to feed her moppets, and I will pay the price."

            The woman tearfully thanks the stranger and leaves with enough food for all of her children. The butcher is amazed by this kindness and inquires why
            the stranger would sacrifice so much of his money. The stranger stated, "On this crossroad, I seek the way to paradise. I will not carry my money or possessions with me for much longer,
            but I wish to carry kindness and show Buddha that I have followed a righteous path."</p>
        
        
        <p class="content">The butcher was swayed by the stranger's kindess, and vowed to change his ways on the path to paradise, only seeking to aid others and live without
            meaningless possessions. While walking to paradise, the butcher came across another man, The Vegetarian. The Vegetarian stated, 'I have denied myself the luxury of meat, 
            for no man worthy of paradise will be thou who dined on the flesh of living creatures.' The butcher was discouraged by this prediction, and begged the Vegetarian
            to escort him to paradise and plea on his behalf. The Vegetarian agreed, and soon the two men were trudging through the road to paradise.</p>
        
        <p class="content">On the road to paradise, the two men came across a large palace filled with beautiful women and indulgent foods. The women beckoned the men to come inside the palace
            and dine with them. The butcher recused himself, and chose to sleep outside rather than falling victim to selfish and impure urges. The Vegetarian, however,
            chose to join the women in the palace and dine with them.</p>
        
        <p class="content">As night turned to day and the sun rose, the butcher awoke to the sound of moist slithering and crunching bone. When the butcher opened his eyes, he noticed
            the Vegetarian had fallen victim to a pit of large snakes and was being eaten alive. The butcher, terrified for his life, now understood that the beautiful
            women were a test of faith, and quickly continued his journey to paradise, content that he had passed the test and proved his plight. </p>
